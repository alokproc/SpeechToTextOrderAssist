# Speech To Text Order Assist
## Summary

In recent years, we have witnessed a revolution in the ability of computers to understand and to convert natural speech, especially with the application of deep neural networks (e.g., Google Home Mini, Alexa etc). In particular, automated speech systems are still struggling to recognize simple words and commands. They donâ€™t engage in a conversation flow and force the user to adjust to the system instead of the system adjusting to the user. The key focus of this project is to speed up the process flow of ordering at restaurants. This is especially useful in a drive-thru and take-out services to get through the queue quickly. Currently, a lot of resources and man-power is wasted by a person taking manual orders. Eventually, this could replace the person taking orders and save the money and time for both user and business end. The Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) Assist aims to accomplish the above. It would start out by hearing the order, transcribe it to text. From the converted text we would be able to classify the intent of parts of the speech such as adding, deleting, modifying and canceling an order. The extracted information is then used for keyword extraction and invoice generation.
